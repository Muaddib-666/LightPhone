This Python script will take a collection of local music files and compile them into a single track with options for encoding quality and creating a gapless playback. As the audio compiles, album artwork and facts about the band are shown (if available). This code has been tested on Windows, but not on Mac. You'll need to run the python script through the CMD window which will then pop up a GUI.
